# NER_image_classification

## Task 1
In the first task I used MNIST dataset and built 3 classification models around it.

Here is some Exploratory Data Analysis:

1) Random Forest;
   
   Here I used Grid Search for findng the best parameters and the accuracy of the model is 96.26%
3) Feed-Forward Neural Network;
   
   Accuracy on test data for FFNN: 97.95%
5) Convolutional Neural Network;
   
   For these models I used train/validation loss approach to find the best parameters.
   Accuracy on test data for CNN: 98.91%
